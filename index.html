      <h1>Introducing Dayboard: A Web App That Helps You Focus On Your Most Important Tasks Each Day</h1>
      <p><eM>It’s no secret: not everything on our to-do lists are worth doing. Spend a day doing busywork and you’ll end your day feeling guilty and unproductive, but get one important task done and you’ll be making progress. Real progress comes from our most important tasks.</em></p>
      <p>Dayboard is a daily task management app that helps you complete your most important tasks each day. Unlike other to-do lists, Dayboard limits users to just five tasks per day. Every time you open a new tab, Dayboard’s browser extension (currently only available to Chrome users) gently remind you of the task at hand. This helps you stay focused, prevents you from feeling overwhelmed, and helps fight distractions like Twitter and Facebook — allowing you to focus on the work that truly matters.</p>
      <p>Dayboard has already helped many people feel great about their work. Over 7500 users have downloaded the browser extension.</p>
      <p><strong>Here’s what some of our users have to say:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>This is an awesome chrome extension. I’ve been using it for a few days, and you really have no idea how often you open a new tab until you have something meaningful on it. I love it and hope they keep supporting it.<br/><em>&mdash; Nick C. via the Chrome Web Store</em></blockquote>
      <blockquote>A great productivity app. Having my task list staring me in the face every time i start a new tab has considerably cut down on my frivolous browsing and allowed me to focus without being obtrusive like other solutions I have tried.<br/><em>&mdash; Connor M. via the Chrome Web Store</em></blockquote>
      <p>Our users love Dayboard and we think you would to. To get a feel for how Dayboard works for individuals, you can download the Chrome extension below:</p>

      <p><strong>Dayboard also works great for teams.</strong> By capturing everyone’s daily priorities, teams gain visibility of what’s happening in a company in ways most project management and task management apps can’t. For example, most project management apps are great for giving a bird’s eye view of the companies’ general priorities, but fail to capture individual day-to-day tasks. So instead, companies often rely on stand-up meetings, a practice that might not make sense for large teams or teams collaborating across different time zones.</p>

      <p>There’s still a lot of room for improvement so expect to see new features and updates, including a new add-on for Firefox and Safari, in the coming months.</p>
